<p>This demo client implements a toy booking site, as described in the user guide (it can be found <a href="https://github.com/usinesoft/Cachalot/blob/master/Doc/CachalotUserGuide.pdf">here&gt;&gt;</a>)</p>
<p>It is mostly a showcase of the massive feeding and querying capabilities of the database.</p>
<p>In order to run this example application, two servers need to be started on ports: <strong>48401,48402</strong>
Command files are provided to start these servers: <strong>start01.cmd</strong> and <strong>start02.cmd</strong></p>
<p>The port is specified in <strong>node_config.json</strong></p>
