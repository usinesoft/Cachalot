Running "booking marketplace"
==============================================

This demo client implements a toy booking site, as described in the user guide (it can be found [here>>](https://github.com/usinesoft/Cachalot/blob/master/Doc/CachalotUserGuide.pdf))

It is mostly a showcase of the massive feeding and querying capabilities of the database.

In order to run this example application, two servers need to be started on ports: **48401,48402**
Command files are provided to start these servers: **start01.cmd** and **start02.cmd**

The port is specified in **node_config.json**
